# NOTEBOOK 💻

NOTEBOOK was a school assignment to train my frontend and backend skills in creating a "full stack" React application on my own. There is a lot that can be improved in this project. I will continue to work with it in my spare time and those who are interested are welcome to send pull requsets... 👾
